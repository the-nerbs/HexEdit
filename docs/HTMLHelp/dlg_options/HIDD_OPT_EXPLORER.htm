<p>This page allows you to change options used in the <a HREF="../dlg_file/Explorer_Dialog.htm">HexEdit 
 Explorer</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt; font-weight: bold;">Wipe Strategy</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">You can delete and wipe a file by right-clicking 
 it in the Explorer window and selecting the option from the context menu 
 (assuming the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Custom Context menu</span> 
 option is selected - see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">When you wipe a file all bytes are overwritten 
 to remove any data they contain. However, just overwriting a disk block 
 with different data does not (in theory) obliterate all trace of the previous 
 data. It's possible that a criminal with special hardware could recover 
 some of the data even though it has been overwritten. Consequently &quot;wipe&quot; 
 tools usually provide different strategies which trade off speed and security. 
 For almost everybody the &quot;Good&quot; strategy should be more than 
 sufficient as it overwrites each byte three times (all bits on, then a 
 random value, then all bits off). The &quot;Thorough&quot; strategy is 
 slow and is based on a security standard (TBD reference needed).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><img src="../ex_red_sm.jpg"
										style="border: none;
												width: 17px;
												height: 20px;"
										width=17
										height=20
										border=0> WARNING: HexEdit makes 
 every effort to force the data to be written to the physical disk between 
 passes. However, some hardware (controllers or drives) may cache data. 
 It's possible, though unlikely, that with poorly designed hardware even 
 using the &quot;Thorough&quot; strategy may only write to the physical 
 disk once.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">As well as wiping the current data of 
 the file HexEdit also extends the file before wiping so that any data 
 in the last cluster of the file after the current end of file is also 
 wiped. This ensures that old data is wiped if the file has been shortened.

		style="border: none;

		width=17

		border=0> But note that if a file is shortened such that blocks 
 from the end of the file were added back to the partition's free list 
 then <span style="font-weight: bold;">these blocks will not be erased</span> 
 and data from these blocks may be recoverable. If this case is important 
 to you then you should obtain a tool that can &quot;wipe&quot; all free 
 blocks on the disk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not 
 Indexed Attribute</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Every file on disk has a set of flags 
 or attributes. These are displayed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Attributes</span> 
 column in the Explorer tool window. Attributes that have always been supported 
 in Windows (and MSDOS) are R (read-only), H (hidden), S (system) and A 
 (archived).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Windows now supports other attributes 
 like like compressed and encrypted. Another attribute is to mark a file 
 to <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be indexed. (Windows has 
 an indexing service that scans and &quot;indexes&quot; files in the background 
 for faster searches.) Some people find it confusing to have a flag that 
 indicates that something does not occur so HexEdit provides two options:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span> 
 is displayed in the file attributes to indicate that a file <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> 
 be indexed - ie, the Not Indexed flag is off</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span> 
 is displayed in the file attributes to indicate that the file will not 
 be indexed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keep 
 tree synchronized with active folder</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This option updates the Explorer folder 
 view (the tree view to the left of or above the file view) whenever the 
 currently displayed directory of folder is changed. This happens whether 
 you double-click a folder name, type in a new folder name </p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use 
 Custom Context menu</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">When this option is selected HexEdit will 
 display a custom context menu when you right-click any file.</p>
