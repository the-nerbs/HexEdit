<h2><font style="font-family: Arial;"
			face=Arial>Introduction</font></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This section will explain in detail what binary files are, ie, the type 
 of data they can contain, and how it is stored.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new topics on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Boolean Operations</span>, 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Numeric Operations</span>, and <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Bit Manipulation </span>go further by explaining 
 ways to change binary data. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 information is useful when using the built-in <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit 
 </span> calculator (perhaps in a keystroke macro), or for evaluating 
 expressions in a template, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bits and Bytes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All information in a computer is stored as <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">bits</span>, 
 which can have a value of on or off (true or false, 1 or 0). Nowadays, 
 almost all computers and peripherals (for many reasons) are based on storing 
 bits in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">bytes</span> 
 or chunks of 8 bits. Admittedly, many processors (CPUs) transfer data 
 to and from memory in chunks of 16, 32 and even 64 bits, but they invariably 
 have some instructions that operate on a single byte even if they have 
 to take an extra 8, 24 or 56 bits along for the ride.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, storage and transmission of data (except at the lowest levels 
 of software and hardware) always deals with bytes. Files on disk or tape 
 are outwardly stored as a number of bytes in a specific order (although 
 at the physical level they may be stored as very large chunks of bits 
 or bytes).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is often necessary to identify an individual bit in a byte (or in 
 a larger entity such as a word). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 convention is to number bits right to left starting at zero for the least 
 significant or &quot;low order&quot; bit. That is, bit X stores the binary 
 digit for 2^X. Since there are 8 bits in a byte these are numbered from 
 0 to 7. Similarly, the bits of a word are numbered 0 to 15, etc.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Conventions and Terms</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although some have been known to refer to anything from a chunk of 6 
 bits to a word of 16 bits as a byte, I will only refer to the more conventional 
 8-bit byte. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 definition of a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">word</span> 
 is even less precise, as it typically refers to the &quot;natural&quot; 
 size of an integer for a specific processor so can be anything from 8 
 bits to 64 bits. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Typically, 
 in an MSDOS or Windows environment a word refers to a 16-bit value.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be precise here are the terms that I will use:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bit = storage for one binary digit</p>

<p>Byte = 8 bits</p>

<p>Nybble&nbsp;= 4 bits, or half a byte</p>

<p>Word&nbsp;= 16 bits, or 2 bytes</p>

<p>Double-word&nbsp;= 32 bits, 4 bytes, or 2 words</p>

<p>Quad-word&nbsp;= 64 bits, 8 bytes, or 4 words</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will also use an asterisk (*) to indicate multiplication, and a caret 
 (^) to indicate raising to a power. So 2^4 means 2 raised to the power 
 4 (or 2*2*2*2).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will also refer to the CPU (central processing unit) as the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">processor</span>. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is the hardware at the heart of the computer that reads from memory (RAM), 
 manipulates data and writes back to memory. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->An 
 example is the Intel Pentium series of processors.</p>
