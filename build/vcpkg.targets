    TODO: how to handle this path?
    (Also need to import these vcpkg props/targets files from the cpp props/targets!)
    
    GitHub actions use an environment variable `VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT`.
    Azure pipelines seem to use the same images as that based on:
      https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-image-generation
    being archived and linking to:
      https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments

  <Import Project="$(VCPkgMSBuildScriptsDir)vcpkg.targets" />

  <Target Name="CheckValidPlatform" BeforeTargets="Build">
    <Error Text="Unsupported architecture combination. Remove the 'vcpkg' nuget package."
           Condition="'$(VCPkgEnabled)' != 'true' and '$(VCPkgDisableError)' == ''"/>
  </Target>
