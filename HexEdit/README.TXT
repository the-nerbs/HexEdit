This directory (including certain subirectories) contains all 
the files required to build HexEdit.exe apart from some (open-
source) libraries.  It includes all the C++ source code (*.cpp and
*.h files), resource source files (HexEdit.rc, etc), etc.

The help source files are also included but require RoboHelp,
though the latest help file (HexEdit.chm) is included. The
installer files are also included but require InstallAware.

Also included is the Visual Studio project For VS2010 and later.

A description of some of the files is provided below.

If you extracted these files from a .ZIP file then you must have a
means of extracting using long file names.  Also you must use any
options that extract sub-directories, since there are files in the
RES and other sub-directories.

Note that a prebuilt release of HexEdit is available separately
on the releases page https://github.com/the-nerbs/HexEdit/releases.


About the Code
--------------

The source code for the original HexEdit was completely mine (apart
from libraries from Microsoft), but since HexEdit 1.0 was released in
1999 open-source code and libraries have been used including:

- Boost C++ library
- FreeImage
- MPIR (forked from GMP)
- Crypto++
- zlib
- MFC Grid Control and MFC controls/code from CodeProject

The program is quite reliable having very few reported bugs, though 
there are a few design issues.  There has only ever been one reported
bug that caused HexEdit to crash.

Another good metric that the program is relatively stable is that
Bounds Checker found few problems (although I haven't used it since
June 1998).  I exercised every aspect and condition of the program
that I could think of, but Bounds Checker only reported a few
problems deep in the MFC code none of which I could track back to
anything in my code.  I also used the Final Check option.

As the code was, at least initially, just a test program as I learnt
to use MFC it is not of the highest quality as far as maintainability
or reusability go.  Nevertheless, there are a few components that
you can easily use in other programs.

In particular, range_set.h implements a class that when used as a
container for integral types is completely compatible with the STL
container std::set.  When used with sets that have large contiguous
chunks it is more space and time efficient than std::set.  (For more on
range_set see my article in the June 99 issue of C/C++ Users Journal.)

Also timer.h implements a simple, but useful, low-resolution timer
class.  Boyer.h/boyer.cpp implements a class for doing Boyer-Moore searches
on a chunk of memory.

The class CScrView (ScrView.cpp/.h) was originally intended as a
better CScrollView.  I wrote it because I had major problems with
CScrollView under Windows 95, mainly due to the use of 16 bit values
to store pixel coordinates.  However, CScrView became a bit messy
when I tried to make it mapping mode independent.  It is probably
also more tightly coupled with CHexEditView than necessary.


How HexEdit was Developed
-------------------------

HexEdit was written in my spare time mainly during the first half of
1998.  I wrote it to become familiar with C++, Windows and MFC
programming.  Prior to this I had written only a little C++ and
Windows C code and no MFC, although I have been using C under
UNIX and MSDOS for more than 15 years.

HexEdit was written, built and tested entirely using Microsoft Visual
C++ 5.0 in the Developer Studio 97 IDE.  All knowledge about MFC
comes from the book "The Revolutionary Guide to MFC 4 Programming
with Visual C++" by Mike Blaszczak, which despite its name is a good
book.  All Knowledge of C++ comes from "The C++ Programming Language"
1st, 2nd and 3rd editions, by Bjarne Stroustrup.

Since the above was written HexEdit has been updated many times and
is now built using VC++11 which comes with Visual Studio 2012.
